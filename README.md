====================

Me and my teamates made a web app called Simplist.This was Client Server UOttawa Project. 
It's pretty much a ToDo list web application that allows you add task and take off task using Get/Post/Delete Request using Restful API. To be able to run this you will need to run this on a server since every task you add and delete stays in the "cloud". So pretty much if you add/delete/post a task and open up another browser on the same computer or different PC using the same host name you will see the added/post/deleted task.
